# First Repository from the Git and GitHub Course

This is my first versioned repository during the Git and GitHub Desktop course.

Created during a live class.

## About

This project was created to practice:

- Creating repositories  
- Commits and version control  
- Using GitHub Desktop  
- Editing files directly on the GitHub website  

This line was added directly through the GitHub editor. Itâ€™s really interesting to see it working in practice.
